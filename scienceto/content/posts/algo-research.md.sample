To calculate the reliability of our system with $n$ redundant nodes, each with a failure probability $p$, we use:

$$
\begin{equation}
R = 1 - p^n
\end{equation}
$$

We can also express complex Fourier transforms for signal processing:

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} dx$$
